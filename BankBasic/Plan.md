Real Planning:-

#INTERFACE
The interface starts with a login :-
1) login 
2) sign in

Account:- have the details of the customer
Bank:- have the details of the account being opened
DB


You know what do it with existing Bank.py

i think i need to create my own library for the interface..


and it didn't worked, cause the library has some windows importing issues.
