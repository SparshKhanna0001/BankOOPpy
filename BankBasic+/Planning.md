### Bank Management System - Crash Course (Conceptual Overview)

#### Step 1: Identify the Entities
The primary entities in a bank management system are:
- **Bank**
- **Customer**
- **Account** (including subtypes such as SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount)
- **Transaction**

#### Step 2: Determine the Attributes

- **Bank:**
  - **Attributes:** Name, Branches, List of Customers

- **Customer:**
  - **Attributes:** Name, Customer ID, List of Accounts

- **Account:**
  - **Attributes:** Account Number, Balance, Account Type, Interest Rate (specific to SavingsAccount)

- **Transaction:**
  - **Attributes:** Transaction ID, Date, Amount, Transaction Type (Deposit, Withdrawal)

#### Step 3: Determine the Behaviors

- **Bank:**
  - **Behaviors:** Add Customer, Remove Customer, Open Account, Close Account

- **Customer:**
  - **Behaviors:** View Account Details, Perform Transactions (Deposit, Withdraw)

- **Account:**
  - **Behaviors:** Deposit Money, Withdraw Money, View Balance, View Transactions

- **Transaction:**
  - **Behaviors:** Record Transaction

#### Step 4: Establish Relationships

- **Bank** has many **Customers**.
- **Customer** can have multiple **Accounts**.
- **Account** can have multiple **Transactions**.

### Detailed Entity Explanation

#### 1. **Bank**
The bank entity acts as the central repository of customers and their accounts. It manages customer registration, account opening, and closing.

- **Attributes:**
  - `name`: The name of the bank.
  - `branches`: The number or list of branches the bank has.
  - `customers`: A list of customers registered with the bank.

- **Behaviors:**
  - `add_customer`: Adds a new customer to the bank.
  - `remove_customer`: Removes a customer from the bank.
  - `open_account`: Opens a new account for a customer.
  - `close_account`: Closes an existing account of a customer.

#### 2. **Customer**
The customer entity represents the bank's clients. Each customer can have multiple accounts.

- **Attributes:**
  - `name`: The name of the customer.
  - `customer_id`: A unique identifier for the customer.
  - `accounts`: A list of accounts the customer holds.

- **Behaviors:**
  - `view_accounts`: Displays the details of all accounts the customer has.
  - `perform_transaction`: Allows the customer to deposit or withdraw money from an account.

#### 3. **Account**
The account entity represents a bank account which could be a savings or checking account.

- **Attributes:**
  - `account_number`: A unique number identifying the account.
  - `balance`: The current balance of the account.
  - `account_type`: The type of account (e.g., Savings or Checking).
  - `interest_rate`: The interest rate for savings accounts.

- **Behaviors:**
  - `deposit`: Deposits money into the account.
  - `withdraw`: Withdraws money from the account.
  - `view_balance`: Displays the current balance.
  - `view_transactions`: Displays the list of transactions for the account.

#### 4. **Transaction**
The transaction entity represents a financial transaction, either a deposit or withdrawal.

- **Attributes:**
  - `transaction_id`: A unique identifier for the transaction (UUID).
  - `date`: The date and time when the transaction occurred.
  - `amount`: The amount of money involved in the transaction.
  - `transaction_type`: The type of transaction (Deposit or Withdrawal).

- **Behaviors:**
  - `record_transaction`: Records the transaction details.

### Practical Considerations

#### UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
A UUID is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify information in computer systems. It's often used in scenarios where unique identification across different systems and time is necessary, such as in transaction IDs. UUIDs are standardized by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) and ensure a high probability of uniqueness.

#### Example Use Cases

- **Bank Operations:**
  - Adding and removing customers.
  - Opening and closing accounts.
  - Performing deposits and withdrawals.
  - Viewing account balances and transaction history.

- **Customer Operations:**
  - Registering with the bank.
  - Opening different types of accounts.
  - Managing multiple accounts and transactions.

By understanding these entities and their interactions, you can start thinking about how to translate real-world banking operations into an object-oriented programming structure. Start by defining classes for each entity, their attributes, and behaviors, and then implement the relationships and interactions between them. This approach will help you design a robust and extensible bank management system.
